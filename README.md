# 🦀 Rustlings – My Rust Exercises

This repository contains the exercises from [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) that I completed as part of my journey learning **Rust**.

## 📌 About this project

Rustlings is a collection of hands-on exercises designed to help developers get comfortable with the Rust programming language. Each exercise introduces a specific concept and must be completed correctly for the code to compile.

This repository serves as a personal record of my progress and practice with Rust fundamentals and core language features.

## 📂 Contents

The exercises are organized by topic, covering both basic and advanced Rust concepts, including:

- Variables and mutability  
- Functions  
- Primitive types  
- Structs and enums  
- Error handling  
- Ownership and borrowing  
- Lifetimes  
- Traits and generics  
- And more…

## 🚀 Progress & Goals

I am actively working through these exercises to strengthen my understanding of Rust and its unique concepts, especially the ownership model, borrowing rules, and lifetimes.

This repository reflects my learning process and hands-on experimentation while improving my Rust skills.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the exercises locally, make sure you have Rust installed:

```bash
rustc --version
```

If you don’t have Rust installed yet, you can follow the official guide:
[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derianrddev/rustlings.git
cd rustlings
```

## Install and run Rustlings

Rustlings is installed via Cargo:

### 1) Install Rustlings

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

### 2) Initialize Rustlings

This creates a local `rustlings/` directory with the exercises:

```bash
rustlings init
```

### 3) Move into the Rustlings directory

```bash
cd rustlings
```

### 4) Start Rustlings

This will watch your progress and guide you through the exercises:

```bash
rustlings
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to complete each exercise.
